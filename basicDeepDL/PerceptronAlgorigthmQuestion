A 2 dimensional dataset for 2 classes is given to you. 

Plot the data and comment whether the two classes are linearly seperable or not.

Note that the top 500 rows are of class A and next 500 rows are of class B. 

The dataset I have downloaded from NPTEL course https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ecV07EkXsAXSbukW2c_gNSGVJhC8eiFX/view?usp=sharing

Disclaimer: I have gone through the NPTEL course on Deep learning. And this question was a part of assignment for week 1.
            I will just try to use the dataset given to implement the perceptron algorithm.

P <- inputs with label A in train dataset
N <- inputs with label B in train dataset

initialize w randomly

while !convergence do :
     Pick random x belonging to P U N (read P Union N)
     if (x belongs to P and sum wx < 0)
        w += x
     elif (x belongs to N and sum wx > 0)
        w -= x
